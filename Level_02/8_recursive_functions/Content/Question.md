-- Complete the function below to print the factorial of a given number

> Factorial of a given number n is the product of every number from 1 to n. For example, factorial of 5 is 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 120.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if a:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

what should `a` be replaced with for the function to work?

- `n>1`
- ` n == 1`
- `n >= 1`
- The function will never work
