### Installing Python

Throughout this course, we will be using Python 3. In some operating systems python defaults to python 2 and it might cause issues when you try to run sample code, make sure that you are using python 3 (preferably the latest version) always.

To install python3 on your development environment you can follow the following [article](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)

### Code Editors

Throughout this course, I will be using visual studio code as my IDE, but you can use any other code editor. to set up vscode follow the following [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

The python Extention is installed by default in vs code, if not install the vs code plugin for python.
