## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. These words might not make sense right away but we will explore each of python's features separately in this course.

Python is easy to get started with and is powerful enough to run large web applications.

Python code is relatively easy to understand and has tons of libraries and developers backing it, making it a great language to learn.

_Whenever you see code snippets anywhere, try and type it on your own, don't try to copy-paste it directly, typing it on your own makes you think about what you are doing and train you to write better code_

## What is a Program?

A program is a collection of statements that performs a specific task. or in simple words, it is an abstraction that takes some input and processes it to produce some output.

Let's take a quick example of a program that prints Hello World

## Hello World!

Hello World is usually the first piece of code written in any programming language. It is a very simple program that prints the string `Hello World` to the console.

In python, we use the keyword `print` to print the string `Hello World` to the console.

```python
print("Hello World!") # Prints Hello World
```

- Note that anything after `#` is a comment and is ignored by python.
