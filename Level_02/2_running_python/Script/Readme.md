In this video we will look at various ways we can run python

The first way to run python is to use the python shell, it can be invoked by directly typing python in the command line. and then you can type in the commands you want to run. This is possible because python is an interpreted language.

Python also ships with a GUI Based Shell its called IDLE and it provides the same features as the terminal shell, with some added extras like auto completion, Documentation etc.

The preferred way is to let the IDE run the file , you can also debug files within the IDE, Debugging might not make much sense now, nut in the long run it is extremely useful.

The last way to run code is to use the terminal and supply the python file name.

Python is very strict with spacing/indentation , make sure that everything other than blocks of code are alighed to the left most part of the document.
