Caching is a very important concept in Web Development as a whole, It is one of the methods that can improve the performance of your web application massively, at the same time it can also mess up your entire application if configured incorrectly.

Caching stores the result of complicated calculations and IO operations in some intermediate location, so that anytime the same request comes in again, the result is returned from the cache instead of being calculated again, This saves a lot of time and resources.

Let's say that you created a home page of an application that shows the latest data compiled from various databases and complicated mathematical functions, If the user keeps refreshing the page will be rendered again and again, all the internal operations must be performed again and again which can add unwanted stress to the server and hinders its scalability, Caching can solve such problems if properly implemented.

Django has excellent documentation regarding caching, read them [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/cache/)
