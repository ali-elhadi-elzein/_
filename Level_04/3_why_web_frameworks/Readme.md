You've already seen how servers are written in python, we also created a sample web server as well. Now you must be asking, why learn django, we can hack together a project with plain python and that should work right?

Well, the answer is yes and no, technically you can reinvent the wheel and write a whole server by yourself in plain python, but frameworks like django make that process a whole lot easier.

Frameworks are simply a bunch of code that solves a lot of problems you might face when developing web applications, it allows you to focus on the core of your application and not worry about the low level implementations. Frameworks also bring structure to your projects, structure helps in reading your code and making it easier to understand.

Frameworks also help keep our application safe, Web attacks change every day and keeping track of them and patching them is a very tedious task, web frameworks like django keep track of each vulnerability and issues a fix as soon as its discovered, which makes the developers life easier.

The tagline of django kind of summarises what it tries to solve : "The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines." !

Django is not the only web framework out there, there are tons of web frameworks in all sorts of languages, We'll focus on Django since its one of the most popular one and very easy to get started with.

Enough of the boring stuff now!, let's take django for a test drive.
