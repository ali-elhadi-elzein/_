In this course I will be using VS Code / Visual Studio Code as my IDE, IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment, it brings together all the tools that are required to develop an application under a commond tool.

If you are already familiar with an IDE, Feel free to use it

To install VS Code , Open up the VS Code home page by seraching for vs code and click on the download button, Follow OS specific instructions to install VS Code on your machine.

Once Installed Open Visual Studio Code, Under the file menu open up a file or a folder to start working on them,

VS Code by default does not ship with features for all languages, Instead we have to install extentions to support our languages , To Install an extentention click on the extention icon and then search for the one you want.

To install the python extention, search for python and click on the install button to install it.

You can also add themes, color schemes and all kind of features with extentions, feel free to take a look at the library and figure out the ones that suit you the best, I use the drakula theme, thats why my background looks a bit purplish.

Now that you have your IDE Installed and setup, You are ready to start programming. All the Best!
